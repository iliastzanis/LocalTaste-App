# LocalTaste

LocalTaste is a robust and user-friendly mobile application that showcases local recipes and product recommendations. It aims to provide a reliable and engaging culinary experience for users, allowing them to explore and discover the local culinary delights of Corfu. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the LocalTaste mobile application.

## Software Selection

LocalTaste was developed using the Flutter framework, a cross-platform development tool. Flutter's rich set of widgets and its ability to create visually appealing user interfaces across iOS and Android platforms made it an ideal choice for LocalTaste. The integration with the Dart programming language, which is native to Flutter, streamlined the development process.

## Database Design

Firebase, a comprehensive app development platform, was chosen as the backend infrastructure for LocalTaste. Firebase's firestore database capabilities and user authentication services provided a reliable and scalable solution for storing and retrieving recipe and product data. The database design involved utilizing Firebase's Firestore, which consisted of three collections: "users," "recipes," and "products." This allowed for seamless synchronization of data across devices.

## Implementation

During the implementation phase, the Flutter framework enabled direct testing of the application on various devices, ensuring a smooth user experience across different screen sizes. The app underwent rigorous testing by the development team to identify and address any issues or areas requiring improvement. Version control using Git and GitHub facilitated collaboration among the developers and effective code sharing.
